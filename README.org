   To test this component in a separate Angular project, navigate to
   the root directory of your project and run =npm install
   tech-assessment-gallery=. This will install the component into
   node_modules. Simply =import= the module into your app module to
   begin using the component (don't forget to add it to the =imports= array!):

   =import { GalleryModule } from 'tech-assessment-gallery';=

   The signature for the component is =<my-gallery></my-gallery>=
